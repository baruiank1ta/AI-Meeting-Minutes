AI-Powered Meeting Minutes Generator

This project is a web app that automates the boring part of meetings â€” writing the minutes.
Give it an audio recording, and it will transcribe, analyze, and generate a clean, professional summary with action items. You can also paste in raw transcripts if you already have them. The goal is simple: spend less time typing notes, and more time actually doing the work.
